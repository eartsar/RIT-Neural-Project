Note: All python code in this project requires a valid installation of pybrain on python 2.7


To run our proof-of-testing script that will load in a sample CSV file into pybrain's modules, run the following command:

python testInput.py <input_dataset> <number_of_attributes> <number_of_classes>


Example:
The abalone entries have 3 classes, and non-class attributes. So to run with this dataset, the command is:
python testInput.py abalone_clean.data 8 3
